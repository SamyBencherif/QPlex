Desired Features:

  Input
    Single-Touch / Mouse-Down
      ...data comes as 3-bytes (mouseDown, mouseX, mouseY)
      ...if mouseDown is 0, then mouseX and mouseY should
      ...be discarded
      ...values mousePressed and mouseRelease can be 
      ...inferred by storing the previous mouse state
      ...in a variable such as mouseWasDown (set 0 on 
      ...first frame)
      ...then mousePressed = mouseDown & !mouseWasDown
      ...and mouseReleased = !mouseDown & mouseWasDown
    Typed
    6-Button
      ...requires polyfill. platforms consisting of or
      ...able to emulate a D-PAD and two action buttons
      ...can map to this input style directly
      ...otherwise swipes, tap, and two-finger or double
      ...tap can be used on a touch screen and
      ...WASD-ZX or UP,RIGHT,DOWN,LEFT,Z,X can be used
      ...via keyboard
  Drawing
    Shader
      ...fragment shader
      ...uniform width, height, time
      ...uniform md, mx, my
      ...display maps x [0,1] y [0,1]
      ...x+ right, y+ down
      ...shader is drawn after all
      ...other calls
    Color
      ...even the main buffer support alpha, which
      ...can be useful for shaders
    Triangle-Fill
      ...varies color
    Path-Stroke
      ...straight line from point to point
      ...varies color
      ...varies thickness
      ...varies thickness-expression
        ...ie drawing a stream of squares/circles/etc
      ...a single vertex with thickness=1 should blit a 
      ...single pixel
    Text-Fill
      ...in order to look exactly the same on all 
      ...platforms I will use a personal bitmap
      ...font converted to C-style data format
  Filesystem
    Program-Database
      ...for example if my program is called demo
      ...there will be a file called demo.programdata
      ...which contains any necessary persistent data
  Program-Execution
    ...the previous entries in this desired-feature
    ...list constitute features that host platforms
    ...will need to support. Among those are program
    ...execution capabilities. This is the one
    ...category of requirements that does not need
    ...to be propagated to the client (such as an
    ...in-code eval function).
      ...at most the client could point the
      ...interpreter to an entirely different file
      ...to run
    ...program execution capabilities will be drawn
    ...from the simplest target platform ANSI-C
    Character-Input
    Static-Strings
    String-Comparison
    ...Actually fuck it... I'll make a C-like language

  Misc (bonus, where applicable)
    ... i'm never going to implement these lol
    HTTP-Request
    Microphone Input
    Camera Input
    Accelerometer Input
    GPS Input
